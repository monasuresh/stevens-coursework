# About

Welcome to the repository showcasing coursework I completed for the Master of Science in Computer Science program during my time at Stevens Institute of Technology. Here, you'll find a comprehensive overview of the projects, assignments, and academic pursuits that have contributed to my learning and growth in various domains.

# Courses Covered

1. **CS-590 - Algorithms**: This course dives into advanced data structures, algorithm design, and analysis using modern languages. It covers advanced search trees, hashing, complexity analysis, design techniques, graph algorithms, sorting, and classic algorithms. Hands-on projects I built such as a flight-upgrade system and a telephone network with algorithms solidify the concepts (projects are included in this repository in the folder **CS590_Algorithms**).
2. **CS-525 - Systems Programming**: This course dives into system-level software development in C within the UNIX operating system environment. It covers essential topics such as user/kernel interface, file systems, process management, and interprocess communication, alongside software development practices and debugging techniques specific to LINUX/UNIX systems. This repository contains several C programs in which I practically apply the topics learned in the course. The programs can be found in the folder **CS525_Systems_Programming**.
3. **CS-550 - Computer Organization and Programming**: This course offers a comprehensive overview of computer organization and assembly language programming, covering topics such as stored program computer structure, assembly language programming, data representation, logic design, and processor design, with regular programming assignments. You can locate the assembly programs I've authored in this repository in the **CS550_Computer_Organization_And_Programming folder**.
4. **CS-520 - Introduction to Operating Systems**: This course delves into the intricacies of modern operating systems, covering topics such as processes, concurrency, memory management, file systems, and I/O, aiming to enhance understanding of their interconnections and improve software development efficiency and system performance. Throughout this course, I undertook diverse projects utilizing the C programming language, including the development of a process scheduler employing multiple scheduling algorithms, a disk scheduler implementing various disk scheduling strategies, and a robust login authentication program. The programs I developed can be found in the folder **CS520_Operating_Systems**.
5. **CPE-695 - Applied Machine Learning**: This comprehensive course delves into machine learning theory, algorithms, and practical applications, equipping students with the skills to design systems that autonomously learn and improve over time. Covering topics such as decision tree learning, neural networks, reinforcement learning, and hands-on programming simulations for real-world problem-solving, it offers a robust foundation for understanding and implementing cutting-edge learning algorithms. The programs and team research project planned and executed as a team can be found in the folder **CPE695_Applied_Machine_Learning**.
6. **CS-546 - Web Programming**: This course provides a solid foundation in internet programming, delving into languages, concepts, and skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB Express,js, Node.js, jQuery, AJAX, and Bootstrap. Students gain the expertise needed to create complex global websites and hone crucial teamwork and coordination skills essential for success in professional environments. You can find the programs I developed in the folder **CS546_Web_Programming** and the team project designed and developed as a team in the repository https://github.com/monasuresh/habit-tracker.
7. **CS-561 - Database Management Systems**: This course introduces students to fundamental concepts of database management systems, focusing on relational databases through theoretical understanding and practical application for database analysis, programming, and further studies. The course also involves expressing complex OLAP queries in SQL, aiming to demonstrate the intricacies of formulating such queries despite their seemingly simple concepts, with the objective of not only writing the SQL queries but also analyzing and articulating the reasons behind their complexity. The complex SQL queries I implemented as part of this course can be found in the folder **CS561_Database_Management_Systems**.
8. **CS-522 - Mobile Systems and Applications**: This course aims to explore the intersection of mobile computing and cloud-based services, addressing the challenges, opportunities, and privacy implications therein, while equipping students with the skills to develop mobile applications interfacing with the cloud and investigate related research topics. This course incorporates programming assignments that progressively build upon each other, focusing on developing chat applications, to reinforce the concepts covered and provide hands-on experience in mobile computing and its relationship with the cloud. The programming assignemnts I completed can be found in the folder **CS522_Mobile_Systems_And_Applications**.
9. **CS-555 - Agile Methods for Software Development**: This course delves into various agile methodologies such as Extreme Programming, Scrum, Lean, Crystal, Dynamic Systems Development Method, and Feature-Driven Development, exploring their effectiveness in rapidly realizing high-quality, customer-valued software, contrasting them with traditional methodologies, and equipping students with principles and techniques to participate in and manage agile software development through case studies and projects, with practical experience highlighted through examples like a group project for GEDCOM anomaly detection where Scrum practices were employed. The team project can be located in the repository https://github.com/Komal147/GedcomProject and in the folder **CS555_Agile_Methodologies**.
10. **CS-545 - Human-Computer Interaction**: This introduction to Human Computer Interaction (HCI) explores fundamental concepts, principles, and frameworks, alongside interaction models, design guidelines, and methodologies, aiming to enhance user experience through knowledge and application of design principles, thus reducing training costs, error rates, and attracting and retaining users while facilitating effective updates.
