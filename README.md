# Stevens Institute of Technology Coursework

Welcome to the repository showcasing coursework completed during my time at Stevens Institute of Technology. Here, you'll find a comprehensive overview of the projects, assignments, and academic pursuits that have contributed to my learning and growth in various domains.

# Courses Covered

1. **CS-590 - Algorithms**: This course dives into advanced data structures, algorithm design, and analysis using modern languages. It covers advanced search trees, hashing, complexity analysis, design techniques, graph algorithms, sorting, and classic algorithms. Hands-on projects I built such as a flight-upgrade system and a telephone network with algorithms solidify the concepts (projects are included in this repository in the folder CS590_Algorithms).
2. **CS-525 - Systems Programming**: This course dives into system-level software development in C within the UNIX operating system environment. It covers essential topics such as user/kernel interface, file systems, process management, and interprocess communication, alongside software development practices and debugging techniques specific to LINUX/UNIX systems. This repository contains several C programs in which I practically apply the topics learned in the course. The programs can be found in the folder CS525_Systems_Programming
3. **CS-550 - Computer Organization and Programming**: This course offers a comprehensive overview of computer organization and assembly language programming, covering topics such as stored program computer structure, assembly language programming, data representation, logic design, and processor design, with regular programming assignments. You can locate the assembly programs I've authored in this repository in the CS550_Computer_Organization_And_Programming folder.
4. **CS-520 - Introduction to Operating Systems**: This course delves into the intricacies of modern operating systems, covering topics such as processes, concurrency, memory management, file systems, and I/O, aiming to enhance understanding of their interconnections and improve software development efficiency and system performance. Throughout this course, I undertook diverse projects utilizing the C programming language, including the development of a process scheduler employing multiple scheduling algorithms, a disk scheduler implementing various disk scheduling strategies, and a robust login authentication program.
